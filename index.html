   <p>F3AID is a not-for-profit, non-governmental women’s rights organization dedicated to
    the civil, political, economic and social rights of all women and girls. Registered in
    Nigeria in 2016, it was formed by a group of experts with extensive professional
    experience in the fields of gender and development. Our works strive to promote and
    defend gender equality globally by raising awareness, lobbying and advocating gender
    issues. F3AID aspires to contribute to global efforts to address gender disparity. We
    believe in a world where girls and women have the right to live in accordance with
    human dignity.</p>

    <p>F3AID programs implement and support social work services to help individual
      survivors of gender based violence, economic empowerment activities to support
      survivors of violence and women and girls at-risk of violence, community education and
      mobilization projects around gender based violence, training and capacity-building for
      women and girls’ groups, coordination of humanitarian services, and advocacy efforts
      to advance laws preventing violence against women and girls, and the enforcement of
      policies ensuring survivors’ access to care and legal justice.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center; color: blueviolet;">OUR VISION</h3>

<p>F3AID envisions a world where women and girls are not marginalized and or
  discriminated against in their various societies and they can live a violence free life in
  dignity.
  We envision a world in which all women and girls can exercise their human rights to
  access the information, resources, and services they need to enhance and protect
  themselves and achieve their full potential; make informed decisions about their rights,
  free of discrimination, coercion, and violence; and participate in and assume leadership
  of civil society movements to advance their rights.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: center; color: blueviolet;">OUR MISSION</h3>

  <P>It is the mission of F3AID to raise awareness and educate others about global issues
    concerning the rights of women and girls by advocating for change at local, national
    and international levels with regards to the rights of women and girls. Also ensure
    women emancipation to effect deep sustainable change for women’s rights which
    requires women’s collective action and power.</P>
